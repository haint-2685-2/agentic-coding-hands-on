## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: independent — all `[P]`.
- **Phase 2 (Foundation)**: blocks all later phases. Within Phase 2, T010 blocks T011–T014; UI primitives T020–T024 are parallel; T025–T026 require T011 (auth probe).
- **Phases 3–11**: each US is parallelizable after Phase 2, but P1 stories (US1/US2/US3/US4/US5/US9) should land before P2 (US6/US7) and P3 (US8).
- **Phase 12 (Polish)**: after all desired US complete.

### Parallel Opportunities

- All `[P]` Setup tasks run together.
- Within Foundation: T011–T024 (different files) run in parallel after T010.
- All Vitest tasks (`tests/unit/*`) run in parallel.
- US Playwright tasks share `kudo-compose.spec.ts` so they serialize on file-write but ACs are independent at runtime.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (recommended)

1. Phase 1 + 2.
2. US1 (Phase 3) — submit happy path.
3. US2/US3/US4/US5/US9 (Phases 4–8) — full P1 surface.
4. Validate → deploy.
5. US6/US7 (P2), then US8 (P3) incrementally.

---

## Notes

- Each phase completes with a Conventional-Commit `feat(ui): viet-kudo — <phase summary>` commit. Final screen lands as one squashed `feat(ui): implement viet-kudo` commit per constitution V.
- Mark tasks complete `[x]` as they ship.
